## 2024 FRQ #2

###    This question was about making a scoreboard to keep track of each team's score as well as the current active team. We had to create methods that added points to the active team and if they get 0 points, the active team is switched to the other team. The other method is to get the current scores of the teams as well as what team is active.


###    I struggled with the first method; adding points to the active team and switching the active team if the other team received 0 points. I was a bit confused on how to switch the active team but in the end, I made 2 more variables that kept track of the active team to make the code work properly.


###    Prior experiences that helped were most likely doing practice FRQ 2's from the past. They all had a similar structure and more or less followed the same pattern of writing classes.


###    I learned to not overthink the question and to think on a broader spectrum. This includes the baby steps it would take to switch the active team or even adding the points to the active team. i also learned that FRQ 2 isn't necessarily hard but you need to understand what is going on
