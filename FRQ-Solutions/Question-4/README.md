## 2024 FRQ #4

###    This question is about a grid path and the path it would take in order to reach the next block or eventually the end of the grid. There were conditions to not go beyond the bounds of the 2D array. For part a, we had to choose the next location the pat was going to go. We had to look at the neighbor to the right as well as the bottom to decide. Whichever one was smaller was the winner and we went on that path. For part b, we had to get the sum of paths of the smallest number until we reached the end. We also could not go beyond the bounds. 


###    I basically struggled with most of this question because of the time constraint. There was no time to think about the logic of this question. I had no clue how to return an object, a Location, since we never really had to deal with that scenario during class. Also, going beyond the bounds was also a tricky concept that I understood but did not understand at the same time.


###    The FRQ #4 about 2D arrays from past exams helped me with this question but they were different from this one. I guess I was so prepared for something similar to the questions from the past that I did not know what to do when Collegeboard threw in a random concept for the test. The classwork also was nice and helpful for this question because of feedback from others about different coding projects.


###    From coding this in replit, I learned how to return an object. It is very similar to returning a string or int or whatever. You need to either make an object name and return it or return a brand-new made object. I also understood better how to not go over the bounds.
