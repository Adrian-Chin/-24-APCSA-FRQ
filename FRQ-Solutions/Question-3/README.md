## 2024 FRQ #3

###    This question is about an array list. We have to check the list and return a boolean under some conditions. The condition is the word after the first word NEEDS to contain the word to the left somewhere within that word. For example, this would return true; {cat, cats, manycats}, while this would return false; {many, boot}. The other part of the question required you to create a new list to add words from the previous list under different conditions. It would take in a string as a parameter and check if the first letters of the word in the previous list matches with the target string. if this is the case, add the word to the new list. If the string matches the word, add an empty string.


###    I struggled with the large chunks of code. For example, 
````
result.add(wordList.get(i).substring(target.length()));
````
### would get really confusing to read since it has a lot of .(something) as well as other code snippets within the full code. On the test, I also struggled with some of the logic, mainly because of the time pressure I was in.


###    Prior experiences that helped included the various practice sets of FRQ #3 geared toward this question. Most FRQ 3's had a similar concept with being an array list as well as knowing the proper string/ int methods there were to use. We also did a project on it so I think that was also useful.


###    I learned that array lists weren't as daunting or tedious as they were originally. They are useful for projects and can be utilized most likely on my website at some point.
